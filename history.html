      <p>
        An early variation of the game was played in the Roman Empire, around the 1st century B.C. It was called "terni lapilli," which means "three pebbles at a time." The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Roman ruins. Evidence of the game was also found in ancient Egyptian ruins.
        The first print reference to "noughts and crosses," the British name for the game, appeared in 1864. The first print reference to a game called "tick-tack-toe" occurred in 1884 but referred to a children's game played on a slate.
